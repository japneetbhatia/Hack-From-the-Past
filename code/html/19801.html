               <p>To transform your room with some of that '80s spirit, ditch the neutral wall color and opt for a more vivid shade. You don't have to go with dated pastel shades such as peach and aqua, though. Opt for saturated shades such as red, purple or cobalt for a vibrant look.</p>

                <p>As simple as the 80s were, those years are considered by most to be the best times of their lives. There are a million movies and television series that were filmed in the 80s, or that revolve around events that took place at the time. Although they may come close to recreating what life was like in the eighties, they can never fully bring us a complete picture. One of the things that can help us understand how a regular day in the life was like back then is knowing what entertainment was like at the time. How did kids, teens and adults spend their time off?</p>

            <li>Spacewar! was devised in 1961 and is one of the earliest known digital computer games.</li>
            <li>In 1962 the audio (compact) cassette was invented.
          </li>
          <li>In 1963, the first touch-tone telephones were introduced.</li>
          <li>In 1966, the first Intercity train was used, which could travel much quicker than old steam and diesel trains. Many trains now run using electricity, which is much quieter and cleaner.</li>
      <li>On 4th July 1967 Donald Campbell broke the world water speed record on Coniston Water in the Lake District. He successfully reached a speed of over 320mph but was instantly killed when his boat, Bluebird K7 flipped over and disintegrated.
      </li>
      <li>In 1969, the first pelican crossings were introduced which had a button for pedestrians to press when the wanted to cross the road and an illuminated 'green man' which flashed when the traffic had to be stopped and it was safe to cross over. Their name is derived from PELICON, an acronym of 'pedestrian light controlled'.</li>

          Television sets became much more popular during the 1960s, with BBC2 broadcasting its first colour pictures in 1967. </li>
