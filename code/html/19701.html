        <p>A change from sleek to bulky furniture took place in the 1970s. The everyday slender styles moved to a
          bigger, bulkier, and chunky style of furnishings. Additionally, the color palette was dominated by earth
          tones, which became quite popular in this decade. Avocado greens, harvest golds, oranges, and earthy browns
          dominated the color palettes of furniture and accompanying decor.</p>

        <p>Music, like today, was a big part of having fun. Popular genres people liked in the 70s were Disco and Rock.
          Jackson Five and Bob Marley were some bands and musicians favored at that time. With this music came obviously
          dances. Dances like the hustle, the YMCA dance, the funky chicken dance, and the sprinkler. The hustle was
          made when a singer by the name of Van McCoy told everyone to do the hustle in 1975 in his poplar song of the
          same name. There wasn't just one way to do the hustle, there were many different styles for example West Coast
          and East Coast as well as partner and line dance variations. Everybody knows the YMCA which was anot iconic
          song ofor 1978. People loved it as much as they love it now. The movement of this only used your arms to make
          the letters Y M C and A above your head. The Funky Chicken Dance was a solo dance that imitated the jerky
          movements of a chicken. It had steps like chicken wings and chicken legs which was different from the Chicken
          Dance done at parties and places like that. Lastly is the sprinkler. It was just a dance invented for fun. You
          extend one arm out at your side have the other bent while holding your hand up to your head then move your arm
          in a slow staccato fashion like you are a sprinkler watering a lawn. The lawnmower, electric slide, and the
          bump were also very enjoyed and used to dance.</p>

            <p>Fashion in the 1970s was about individuality. In the early 1970s, Vogue proclaimed "There are no rules in
              the fashion game now"[1] due to overproduction flooding the market with cheap synthetic clothing. Common
              items included mini skirts, bell-bottoms popularized by hippies, vintage clothing from the 1950s and
              earlier, and the androgynous glam rock and disco styles that introduced platform shoes, bright colors,
              glitter, and satin.</p>

            <p> New technologies brought advances in production through mass production, higher efficiency, generating
              higher standards and uniformity. Generally the most famous silhouette of the mid and late 1970s for both
              genders was that of tight on top and loose on bottom. The 1970s also saw the birth of the indifferent,
              anti-conformist casual chic approach to fashion, which consisted of sweaters, T-shirts, jeans and
              sneakers. The French designer Yves Saint Laurent and the American designer Halston both observed and
              embraced the changes that were happening in the society, especially the huge growth of women's rights and
              the youth counterculture. They successfully adapted their design aesthetics to accommodate the changes
              that the market was aiming for.</p>
