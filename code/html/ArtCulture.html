        Moving through the decades, the trends of the 1960s brought a whimsical style to modern furniture. Bright,
        psychedelic patterns and bold bursts of color were mainstream. The sleek and low style of the 1950s were still
        popular, but trendy furnishings such as one-piece molded or blow-up chairs were new innovations. -->

        <p>A change from sleek to bulky furniture took place in the 1970s. The everyday slender styles moved to a
          bigger, bulkier, and chunky style of furnishings. Additionally, the color palette was dominated by earth
          tones, which became quite popular in this decade. Avocado greens, harvest golds, oranges, and earthy browns
          dominated the color palettes of furniture and accompanying decor.</p>

      <p>To transform your room with some of that '80s spirit, ditch the neutral wall color and opt for a more vivid
        shade. You don't have to go with dated pastel shades such as peach and aqua, though. Opt for saturated shades
        such as red, purple or cobalt for a vibrant look.</p>
