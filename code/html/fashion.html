        The Sixties was a decade of huge fashion, music and social change. Conventions were challenged and old attitudes
        faded. The voting age dropped to 18, mini skirts became the norm and pop music blared from every teenagerâ€™s
        radio. People had more money and a disposable income than before and now had the time to enjoy it. The Sixties
        created great optimism and will always be remembered as a time of freedom, social change and fun!
      </p>
      <p>Fashion of the 1960s featured a number of diverse trends. It was a decade that broke many fashion traditions,
        mirroring social movements during the time. Around the middle of the decade, fashions arising from small pockets
        of young people in a few urban centers received large amounts of media publicity, and began to heavily influence
        both the haute couture of elite designers and the mass-market manufacturers.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Fashion in the 1970s was about individuality. In the early 1970s, Vogue proclaimed "There are no rules in the
        fashion game now"[1] due to overproduction flooding the market with cheap synthetic clothing. Common items
        included mini skirts, bell-bottoms popularized by hippies, vintage clothing from the 1950s and earlier, and the
        androgynous glam rock and disco styles that introduced platform shoes, bright colors, glitter, and satin.</p>

      <p> New technologies brought advances in production through mass production, higher efficiency, generating higher
        standards and uniformity. Generally the most famous silhouette of the mid and late 1970s for both genders was
        that of tight on top and loose on bottom. The 1970s also saw the birth of the indifferent, anti-conformist
        casual chic approach to fashion, which consisted of sweaters, T-shirts, jeans and sneakers. The French designer
        Yves Saint Laurent and the American designer Halston both observed and embraced the changes that were happening
        in the society, especially the huge growth of women's rights and the youth counterculture. They successfully
        adapted their design aesthetics to accommodate the changes that the market was aiming for.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Fashion of the 1980s placed heavy emphasis on cheap clothes and fashion accessories. Apparel tended to be very
        bright and vivid in appearance. Women expressed an image of wealth and success through shiny costume jewelry,
        such as large faux-gold earrings, pearl necklaces, and clothing covered with sequins and diamonds. Punk fashion
        began as a reaction against both the hippie movement of the past decades and the materialist values of the
        current decade.[2] The first half of the decade was relatively tame in comparison to the second half, which is
        when the iconic 1980s color scheme had come into popularity.</p>

      <p> Hair in the 1980s was typically big, curly, bouffant and heavily styled. Television shows such as Dynasty
        helped popularize the high volume bouffant and glamorous image associated with it.[3][4] Women from the 1980s
        wore bright, heavy makeup. Everyday fashion in the 1980s consisted of light-colored lips, dark and thick
        eyelashes, and pink or red rouge (otherwise known as blush)</p>

    <img src="../images/fashion1990.jpg" alt="" style="float: left;">
    <div class="content">
      <p>Fashion in the 1990s was defined by a return to minimalist fashion,[1] in contrast to the more elaborate and
        flashy trends of the 1980s. One notable shift was the mainstream adoption of tattoos,[2] body piercings aside
        from ear piercing and to a much lesser extent, other forms of body modification such as branding.</p>

      <p>In the early 1990s, several late 1980s fashions remained very stylish among both sexes. However, the popularity
        of grunge and alternative rock music helped bring the simple, unkempt grunge look to the mainstream by 1992. The
        anti-conformist approach to fashion led to the popularization of the casual chic look that included T-shirts,
        jeans, hoodies, and sneakers, a trend which continued into the 2000s. Additionally, fashion trends throughout
        the decade recycled styles from previous decades,[4] notably the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.</p>
