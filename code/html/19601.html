        <p>A change from sleek to bulky furniture took place in the 1970s. The everyday slender styles moved to a
          bigger, bulkier, and chunky style of furnishings. Additionally, the color palette was dominated by earth
          tones, which became quite popular in this decade. Avocado greens, harvest golds, oranges, and earthy browns
          dominated the color palettes of furniture and accompanying decor.</p>

            Sixties Entertainment
            The sixties was a time of revolution. New things were coming out, things that children hadn't ever thought
            of. This decade changed the way families lived with the introduction of new entertainment such as cassettes,
            video games, comics, sports, festivals and concerts.
            Sport
            Olympics
            For the 214 athletes that travelled to Rome in 1960 to compete in the Olympics was not only a great honour
            but also great entertainment. The Olympics held in Rome in 1960 was the first games at which broadcaster
            paid The Olympic Organising Committee a fee for the broadcast rights to the Olympic games.

            Four years later the Olympic games were held in Tokyo. Television pictures were broadcast via satellite for
            the first time. This provided pictures and audio of the 1964 Tokyo Games. In total, 40 countries tuned in to
            the Tokyo Games.

            Cricket
            Cricket was also a big sport in Australia. Not only could people play cricket or even backyard cricket with
            their families and friends, they could also watch the team they support on television. With legends such as
            Gordon Rorke who was famous for 'dragging' back his foot during his delivery stride so that when he let the
            ball go he was several feet beyond the bowling crease.

            Tennis
            In the sixties tennis was a popular sport to play and watch. Some families would go out and watch a tennis
            game on an afternoon, some would watch it on the television, while some might go down to the local courts
            and play a few games. Tennis was a great game to play in Australia, not only in the sixties but now too.

            Tennis icons such as Margaret Court were the reason people were so entertained. Her style of playing the
            game became known to Australians in the sixties. She was known for her heavy ground strokes and strong
            serve. She was one of only three players to complete what is called the 'boxed set' by winning the singles,
            doubles and mixed titles at all four majors. She collected 62 major titles all together.

            Horse Racing
            Families got dressed up in their smartest outfits to attend a major horse racing event in Australia in the
            1960's. It was great entertainment for the whole family especially when you're watching your own horse run.

            Horse races such as the Melbourne cup were described as the best. Tension throughout the whole event. Hi
            Jinx, Lord Fury, Even Stevens, Gatum Gatum, Polo Prince, Light Fingers, Galilee, Red Handed and Rain Lover
            were all Melbourne Cup winners from 1960 to 1969.

                The Sixties was a decade of huge fashion, music and social change. Conventions were challenged and old
                attitudes faded. The voting age dropped to 18, mini skirts became the norm and pop music blared from
                every teenagerâ€™s radio. People had more money and a disposable income than before and now had the time
                to enjoy it. The Sixties created great optimism and will always be remembered as a time of freedom,
                social change and fun!
              </p>
              <p>Fashion of the 1960s featured a number of diverse trends. It was a decade that broke many fashion
                traditions, mirroring social movements during the time. Around the middle of the decade, fashions
                arising from small pockets of young people in a few urban centers received large amounts of media
                publicity, and began to heavily influence both the haute couture of elite designers and the mass-market
                manufacturers.</p>

                <li>Spacewar! was devised in 1961 and is one of the earliest known digital computer games.</li>
                <li>In 1962 the audio (compact) cassette was invented.
                </li>
                <li>In 1963, the first touch-tone telephones were introduced.</li>
                <li>In 1966, the first Intercity train was used, which could travel much quicker than old steam and
                  diesel trains. Many trains now run using electricity, which is much quieter and cleaner.</li>
                <li>On 4th July 1967 Donald Campbell broke the world water speed record on Coniston Water in the Lake
                  District. He successfully reached a speed of over 320mph but was instantly killed when his boat,
                  Bluebird K7 flipped over and disintegrated.
                </li>
                <li>In 1969, the first pelican crossings were introduced which had a button for pedestrians to press
                  when the wanted to cross the road and an illuminated 'green man' which flashed when the traffic had to
                  be stopped and it was safe to cross over. Their name is derived from PELICON, an acronym of
                  'pedestrian light controlled'.</li>

                  Television sets became much more popular during the 1960s, with BBC2 broadcasting its first colour
                  pictures in 1967. </li>
