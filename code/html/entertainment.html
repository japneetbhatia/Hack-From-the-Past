        Sixties Entertainment 
The sixties was a time of revolution. New things were coming out, things that children hadn't ever thought of. This decade changed the way families lived with the introduction of new entertainment such as cassettes, video games, comics, sports, festivals and concerts.
Sport 
Olympics
For the 214 athletes that travelled to Rome in 1960 to compete in the Olympics was not only a great honour but also great entertainment. The Olympics held in Rome in 1960 was the first games at which broadcaster paid The Olympic Organising Committee a fee for the broadcast rights to the Olympic games. 

Four years later the Olympic games were held in Tokyo. Television pictures were broadcast via satellite for the first time. This provided pictures and audio of the 1964 Tokyo Games. In total, 40 countries tuned in to the Tokyo Games. 

Cricket
Cricket was also a big sport in Australia. Not only could people play cricket or even backyard cricket with their families and friends, they could also watch the team they support on television. With legends such as Gordon Rorke who was famous for 'dragging' back his foot during his delivery stride so that when he let the ball go he was several feet beyond the bowling crease.

Tennis
In the sixties tennis was a popular sport to play and watch. Some families would go out and watch a tennis game on an afternoon, some would watch it on the television, while some might go down to the local courts and play a few games. Tennis was a great game to play in Australia, not only in the sixties but now too.

Tennis icons such as Margaret Court were the reason people were so entertained. Her style of playing the game became known to Australians in the sixties. She was known for her heavy ground strokes and strong serve. She was one of only three players to complete what is called the 'boxed set' by winning the singles, doubles and mixed titles at all four majors. She collected 62 major titles all together.

Horse Racing
Families got dressed up in their smartest outfits to attend a major horse racing event in Australia in the 1960's. It was great entertainment for the whole family especially when you're watching your own horse run. 

Horse races such as the Melbourne cup were described as the best. Tension throughout the whole event. Hi Jinx, Lord Fury, Even Stevens, Gatum Gatum, Polo Prince, Light Fingers, Galilee, Red Handed and Rain Lover were all Melbourne Cup winners from 1960 to 1969.

          <!-- <p>The birth of modern computing was in the 1970s. The world's first general microprocessor, the Intel 4004, came out in November 1971. The C programming language was developed early in the decade and the Unix operating system was rewritten into it in 1973.</p>

           <p> 7 big tech advancements from the 1970s that completely changed the world: </p>
             The Floppy Disk. 
            Portable Cassette Player.
            The All-In-One Personal Computer.
                    The Cell Phone. 
                         VCR.
                            The First “Real” Video Game.

                            <p>Music, like today, was a big part of having fun. Popular genres people liked in the 70s were Disco and Rock. Jackson Five and Bob Marley were some bands and musicians favored at that time. With this music came obviously dances. Dances like the hustle, the YMCA dance, the funky chicken dance, and the sprinkler. The hustle was made when a singer by the name of Van McCoy told everyone to do the hustle in 1975 in his poplar song of the same name. There wasn't just one way to do the hustle, there were many different styles for example West Coast and East Coast as well as partner and line dance variations. Everybody knows the YMCA which was anot iconic song ofor 1978. People loved it as much as they love it now. The movement of this only used your arms to make the letters Y M C and A above your head. The Funky Chicken Dance was a solo dance that imitated the jerky movements of a chicken. It had steps like chicken wings and chicken legs which was different from the Chicken Dance done at parties and places like that. Lastly is the sprinkler. It was just a dance invented for fun. You extend one arm out at your side have the other bent while holding your hand up to your head then move your arm in a slow staccato fashion like you are a sprinkler watering a lawn. The lawnmower, electric slide, and the bump were also very enjoyed and used to dance.</p>

            <p>As simple as the 80s were, those years are considered by most to be the best times of their lives. There are a million movies and television series that were filmed in the 80s, or that revolve around events that took place at the time. Although they may come close to recreating what life was like in the eighties, they can never fully bring us a complete picture. One of the things that can help us understand how a regular day in the life was like back then is knowing what entertainment was like at the time. How did kids, teens and adults spend their time off?</p>

    <p>Popular music in the 1990s saw the continuation of teen pop and dance-pop trends which had emerged in the 1970s and 1980s. Furthermore, hip hop grew and continued to be highly successful in the decade, with the continuation of the genre's golden age. Aside from rap, reggae, contemporary R&B and urban music in general remained extremely popular throughout the decade; urban music in the late-1980s and 1990s often blended with styles such as soul, funk and jazz, resulting in fusion genres such as new jack swing, neo-soul, hip hop soul and g-funk which were popular.</p>
